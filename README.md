# Hmem

Hmem, a holistic memory performance metric, calculated from a fusion of bandwidth and latency metrics across different access patterns. Hmem is able to automate the calculation of various memory metrics and the correlation coefficients between the corresponding memory metrics and load throughput.

# Usage 

In the code repository, `correlation.ipynb` describe the calculation process of Hmem metric. The only thing you need to do is replace your own memory data with the format in the `input.xlsx` table and then just execute the correlation.ipynb file in order.

The `input.xlsx` and `output.xlsx` tables shows the performance data we used to evaluate the metrics in the paper, which you can check if you are interested.
